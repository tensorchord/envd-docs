# envd is participating Hacktoberfest!

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is an open source festival celebrated during October every year, encouraging people worldwide to actively participate and contribute to participating open source projects hosted across GitHub and GitLab.

This year's hacktoberfest is not *ALL* about code. We also need your help with writing, designing, and testing. For the details about non-code contributions, check the doc [here](https://hacktoberfest.com/about/#low-or-non-code).

[envd](https://github.com/tensorchord/envd) is participating Hacktoberfest this year! There are some [first contributor friendly issues](https://github.com/tensorchord/envd/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue+%E2%9D%A4%EF%B8%8F%22).

[Contributing](/community/contributing) and [Development](/community/development) docs may help you get familiar with our codebase and contributing process.

What are you waiting for? Come, join us and celebrate!
