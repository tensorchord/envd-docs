# `envd` Summer of Code 2023

Google Summer of Code ([GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)) is a global, online program focused on engaging new contributors in open source software development. During the 12+ weeks of programming under the guidance of mentors, you will gain hands-on experience in open source software projects.

`envd` is a CLI tool that helps people create the container-based development and deployment environment for AI/ML. We use the following technologies:

- [BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit)
- [Starlark](https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark)
- [ContainerSSH](https://github.com/containerssh/containerssh)

And we're intending to apply to be part of GSoC 2023!

## Get started

Check out our [contributing](/community/contributing) and [development](/developers/development) guides to learn more about how to get started with `envd`.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you meet the [GSoC eligibility requirements](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#what_are_the_eligibility_requirements_for_participation).

If possible, please make at least one code change pull request to any projects under [TensorChord](https://github.com/tensorchord/). The PR doesn't have to be merged, but it does have to be visible to the public.

We would prefer the applicants with container or machine learning experience.

## Application instructions

- Start with a clear and concise description of the problem you want to solve or the feature you want to add.
