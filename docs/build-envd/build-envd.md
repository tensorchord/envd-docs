# Build Your First Environment

envd can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a `build.envd`. A `build.envd` is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.

## Usage

The `envd build` command builds an image from a `build.envd`. `envd up` command builds an image and runs immediately. Traditionally, the `build.envd` and located in the root of the context.  You use the `--path` or `-p` flag with `envd build`/`envd up` to point to a directory anywhere in your file system which contains a `build.envd`.

```bash
$ ls
build.envd ...
$ envd build
```

```bash
# Or you can specify the path.
$ tree .
./examples
└── mnist
    ├── build.envd
    ├── main.py
    ├── mnist.ipynb
    └── README.md
$ envd build --path examples/mnist
```

## build.envd Example

The syntax of `build.envd` is [starlark](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/skylark/language.html), a simplified dialect of Python3. If you know Python, then you can write `build.envd` without an issue.

Here is an example of `build.envd`:

```python title=build.envd
def build():
    base(os="ubuntu20.04", language="python3")
    install.python_packages(name = [
        "numpy",
    ])
    shell("zsh")
    config.jupyter(password="", port=8888)
```

You don't need to worry about it yet. Let's explore how it works in the following sections.

### Hello World

You can create a file `build.envd` in your project directory with these lines:

```python title=build.envd
def build():
    base(os="ubuntu20.04", language="python3")
```

You can save the file and run `envd up`. Congrats! You get your first envd environment.

```text title="envd up"
$ envd up

envd@588f26349c61 $ 
```

You can use `ssh <project-directory-name>.envd` to attach to the environment if you exit from the shell.

```bash title="connect the environment via ssh"
envd@588f26349c61 $ exit
$ ssh demo.envd
envd@588f26349c61 $ # You are in the environment again!
```

Do not forget to remove the environment if you do not use it.

```text title="destroy the environment"
$ envd destroy
INFO[2022-06-10T19:09:49+08:00] <project-directory-name> is destroyed
```

Let's have a look at `build.envd`. `build` is the default function name in `build.envd`. envd invokes the function if you run `envd build` or `envd up`.

:::caution

**A `build.envd` must have a `build` function**.

:::

`base` declares the expected operating system and language that you will use in the environment.

### Install python packages

The [envd install API](../api/install) function `install.python_packages` installs python packages in the environment:

```python title=build.envd
def build():
    base(os="ubuntu20.04", language="python3")
    install.python_packages(name = [
        "numpy",
    ])
```

The function supports general pip syntaxs:

```python
    install.python_packages(name = [
        "numpy==1.4.1",
        "numpy>=1,<2",
        "numpy~=1.4",
    ])
```

Feel free to ask us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/KqswhpVgdU) if you get problems about packages installation. You can verify if it works:

```
$ envd up
envd@2c14bff847f8:$ python3
Python 3.8.10 (default, Mar 15 2022, 12:22:08) 
[GCC 9.4.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import numpy as np
>>> a = np.array([2, 3, 4])
>>> a
array([2, 3, 4])
```

### Use zsh instead of bash

The [envd API](../api/universe) function `shell` configures shell program in the environment:

```python title=build.envd
def build():
    base(os="ubuntu20.04", language="python3")
    install.python_packages(name = [
        "numpy",
    ])
    shell("zsh")
```

You do not need to configure zsh and [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) manually, envd does it.

```bash
$ envd up
(envd) ➜  docs # zsh in the environment
```

### Use jupyter

[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) are a powerful way to write and iterate on your Python code for data analysis. The [envd config API](../api/config) function `config.jupyter` helps you set up jupyter notebooks in the environment:

```python title=build.envd
def build():
    base(os="ubuntu20.04", language="python3")
    install.python_packages(name = [
        "numpy",
    ])
    shell("zsh")
    config.jupyter(password="", port=8888)
```

You can visit [`http://localhost:8888`](http://localhost:8888) after the `envd up`.

![jupyter](./assets/jupyter.png)

### Set a PyPI index mirror (optional)

You can use the envd API function `config.pip_index` to set the PyPI index mirror if it is too slow to install the python packages via `install.python_packages`.

```python title=build.envd
def build():
    config.pip_index(url="https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple")
    base(os="ubuntu20.04", language="python3")
    install.python_packages(name = [
        "numpy",
    ])
    shell("zsh")
    config.jupyter(password="", port=8888)
```

Then the packages will be downloaded from the mirror instead of [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/).

### Complex build.envd example

```python
def build():
    config.apt_source(source="""
deb https://mirror.sjtu.edu.cn/ubuntu focal main restricted
deb https://mirror.sjtu.edu.cn/ubuntu focal-updates main restricted
deb https://mirror.sjtu.edu.cn/ubuntu focal universe
deb https://mirror.sjtu.edu.cn/ubuntu focal-updates universe
deb https://mirror.sjtu.edu.cn/ubuntu focal multiverse

deb https://mirror.sjtu.edu.cn/ubuntu focal-backports main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu focal partner
deb https://mirror.sjtu.edu.cn/ubuntu focal-security main restricted universe multiverse
""")
    config.pip_index(url = "https://mirror.sjtu.edu.cn/pypi/web/simple")
    install.vscode_extensions([
        "ms-python.python",
    ])
    base(os="ubuntu20.04", language="python3")
    install.python_packages(name = [
        "numpy",
    ])
    install.cuda(version="11.6", cudnn="8")
    shell("zsh")
    install.system_packages(name = [
        "htop"
    ])
    git_config(name="Ce Gao", email="cegao@tensorchord.ai", editor="vim")
    run(["ls -la"])
```
